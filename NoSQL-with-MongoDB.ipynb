    "# Introduction to MongoDB and NoSQL databases\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## NoSQL Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NoSQL databases** (Not Only SQL) are a type of database that differ from traditional relational databases in the way they store and manage data. Unlike relational databases, which use tables and structured query language (SQL) to store and retrieve data, NoSQL databases use a variety of data models, such as document-oriented, key-value, graph, and column-family, to store and retrieve data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Here are some **examples** of NoSQL databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Document-oriented databases:** MongoDB is an example of a document-oriented database. In this type of database, data is stored in the form of documents, which are similar to JSON objects. Each document can have different fields and structures, making it easy to store complex, unstructured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Key-value databases:** Redis is an example of a key-value database. In this type of database, data is stored as key-value pairs, where the key is a unique identifier and the value is the data being stored. Key-value databases are designed to be fast and scalable and are often used for caching and session management.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Graph databases:** Neo4j is an example of a graph database. In this type of database, data is stored in the form of nodes and relationships, making it well-suited for storing data with complex relationships, such as social networks or recommendation systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Column-family databases:** Apache Cassandra is an example of a column-family database. In this type of database, data is stored in columns rather than rows, making it well-suited for large-scale, distributed systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** NoSQL databases are often preferred over relational databases for certain use cases, such as when dealing with large amounts of unstructured data, when scalability is a concern, or when the data has complex relationships that are difficult to model in a traditional relational database.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/NoSQLDatabases.jpg\" align=\"center\" height=400px width=400px>\n",

    "## What is MongoDB?\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/intro_mongodb.jpeg\" align=\"center\" height=400px width=400px>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MongoDB** is a `document-oriented NoSQL database` that is designed to be scalable and flexible. Unlike traditional relational databases, which store data in tables and use structured query language (SQL) to retrieve data, MongoDB stores data in documents, which are similar to JSON objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Here are some **examples** to illustrate how MongoDB works:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Storing data in documents:** In MongoDB, data is stored in documents, which are similar to JSON objects. For example, consider a database of books. Each book can be stored as a document with fields for the title, author, ISBN, and so on.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Collections:** Documents are stored in collections, which are similar to tables in relational databases. For example, the books database might have a collection named \"books\" that contains all the books in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Querying data:** MongoDB provides a rich query language that allows you to retrieve data based on various criteria. For example, you can retrieve all books written by F. Scott Fitzgerald by using the following query.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{\n",

    "# Difference between SQL and No-SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL and NoSQL are two different types of database management systems, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Here are some of the key differences between the two:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data model:** SQL databases use a tabular data model, where data is stored in tables with fixed schemas, and each table has a unique primary key. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, use a variety of data models, including document, key-value, graph, and column-family models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scaling:** SQL databases are vertically scalable, which means that to handle more traffic, you need to upgrade your hardware to a more powerful server. NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable, which means that to handle more traffic, you can add more servers to the database cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ACID compliance:** SQL databases are typically ACID compliant, which means that they ensure data consistency, isolation, and durability. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, often sacrifice ACID compliance for performance and scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Query language:** SQL databases use the Structured Query Language (SQL) for querying data, which is a powerful and widely-used language. NoSQL databases use a variety of query languages, including MongoDB's query language, Cassandra Query Language (CQL), and Amazon DynamoDB's API.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use cases:** SQL databases are typically used for applications that require complex queries and transactions, such as banking, finance, and e-commerce. NoSQL databases are often used for applications that require high scalability and performance, such as real-time analytics, IoT, and social media.\n",

To create a collection, you can use the `db.collection_name` syntax, where `collection_name` is the name of the collection. For example, to create a database named `booksdb` and a collection named `books`, you can do the following: \n",

    "- **Data modeling** in MongoDB is the process of designing and organizing data in a way that is optimized for the MongoDB document-oriented data model. It involves creating a schema that defines the structure, relationships, and constraints of the data, and using that schema to create collections and documents. The goal of data modeling in MongoDB is to ensure that the data is stored in a way that is efficient, flexible, and consistent with the requirements of the application.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Create indexes on the fields that are frequently used in queries using the **create_index()** method in PyMongo. For example, if you have a collection of user data and frequently query based on the user's name and age, you could create indexes on those fields like this:\n",

    "- Monitor the performance of your queries using the MongoDB Profiler or other monitoring tools to see if the indexes are improving query performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you are still experiencing performance issues, consider using sharding(we will discuss sharding later) to distribute the data across multiple MongoDB instances. Sharding can improve query performance by allowing for parallel query execution across multiple shards.\n",

    "\n",
    "MongoDB architecture refers to the components and design of a MongoDB database system. It includes the following key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MongoDB Server:** This is the main component of MongoDB architecture, responsible for handling client requests, managing data storage, and executing queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Replication:** Replication is a key aspect of MongoDB architecture, providing high availability and data durability. MongoDB uses a replication mechanism known as replica sets, where data is replicated across multiple servers for redundancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sharding:** Sharding is the process of dividing data across multiple servers to distribute load and improve performance. MongoDB uses a sharding mechanism known as sharded clusters, where data is divided into smaller chunks called shards and distributed across multiple servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Database:** A MongoDB database is a collection of related data stored together in a single unit. Databases are made up of collections, which are equivalent to tables in a relational database.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Collection:** A collection is a group of related documents stored together in a single unit. Documents in a collection are equivalent to rows in a table in a relational database.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Document:** A document is a single unit of data stored in a collection. It is a JSON-like structure, containing one or more key-value pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** Understanding MongoDB architecture is important for ensuring that your database is designed and optimized for your specific use case. It helps you make informed decisions about things like data modeling, replication, and sharding, and ensures that your database is scalable, reliable, and efficient."

    "**Backups** are essential for ensuring that data is protected against loss in the event of a disaster or system failure. MongoDB provides several options for backing up data, including on-demand backups, scheduled backups, and continuous backups. Additionally, MongoDB provides various **recovery** options, such as point-in-time recovery and rollback, to ensure that data can be restored in the event of a disaster. This provides peace of mind and helps organizations ensure that their data is safe and secure.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**MongoDB** provides several mechanisms to backup and recover data in case of hardware failures or accidental data loss. Some of the ways to perform backup and recovery in MongoDB are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **mongodump and mongorestore:** These are command-line utilities provided by MongoDB that are used to backup and restore MongoDB databases. `mongodump` creates a binary export of the data in a MongoDB database, while `mongorestore` imports that binary export back into a MongoDB database. Here is an example of using `mongodump` to backup a database named `mydb`: \n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><b>mongodump --db mydb</b></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "And here is an example of using `mongorestore` to restore that `backup`:\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><b>mongorestore --db mydb dump/mydb</b></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Snapshots:** You can also use hardware snapshots to backup your MongoDB data. This method involves taking a point-in-time snapshot of the data and copying it to a different location. This is often done using tools provided by your cloud provider or storage vendor.\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Replication:** MongoDB supports replication, which involves maintaining multiple copies of data across multiple servers. In case of hardware failure or data loss, one of the replicas can be promoted to primary and take over the responsibilities of the failed primary.\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sharding:** MongoDB also supports sharding, which involves distributing data across multiple servers. In case of hardware failure or data loss, the remaining servers can continue to provide access to the data that was not lost.\n",
