    "\n",
    "## NoSQL Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NoSQL databases** (Not Only SQL) are a type of database that differ from traditional relational databases in the way they store and manage data. Unlike relational databases, which use tables and structured query language (SQL) to store and retrieve data, NoSQL databases use a variety of data models, such as document-oriented, key-value, graph, and column-family, to store and retrieve data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Here are some **examples** of NoSQL databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Document-oriented databases:** MongoDB is an example of a document-oriented database. In this type of database, data is stored in the form of documents, which are similar to JSON objects. Each document can have different fields and structures, making it easy to store complex, unstructured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Key-value databases:** Redis is an example of a key-value database. In this type of database, data is stored as key-value pairs, where the key is a unique identifier and the value is the data being stored. Key-value databases are designed to be fast and scalable and are often used for caching and session management.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Graph databases:** Neo4j is an example of a graph database. In this type of database, data is stored in the form of nodes and relationships, making it well-suited for storing data with complex relationships, such as social networks or recommendation systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Column-family databases:** Apache Cassandra is an example of a column-family database. In this type of database, data is stored in columns rather than rows, making it well-suited for large-scale, distributed systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** NoSQL databases are often preferred over relational databases for certain use cases, such as when dealing with large amounts of unstructured data, when scalability is a concern, or when the data has complex relationships that are difficult to model in a traditional relational database.\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/intro_mongodb.jpeg\" align=\"center\" height=400px width=400px>\n",

    "- **MongoDB** is a `document-oriented NoSQL database` that is designed to be scalable and flexible. Unlike traditional relational databases, which store data in tables and use structured query language (SQL) to retrieve data, MongoDB stores data in documents, which are similar to JSON objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Here are some **examples** to illustrate how MongoDB works:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Storing data in documents:** In MongoDB, data is stored in documents, which are similar to JSON objects. For example, consider a database of books. Each book can be stored as a document with fields for the title, author, ISBN, and so on.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Collections:** Documents are stored in collections, which are similar to tables in relational databases. For example, the books database might have a collection named \"books\" that contains all the books in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Querying data:** MongoDB provides a rich query language that allows you to retrieve data based on various criteria. For example, you can retrieve all books written by F. Scott Fitzgerald by using the following query.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Install MongoDB:** You can download MongoDB from the official [website](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) and install it on your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Install PyMongo**: PyMongo is the Python driver for MongoDB. You can install it using pip: `pip3 install pymongo` , this command is for linux OS.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Connect to MongoDB:** To connect to MongoDB from Python, you need to create a `MongoClient object`. You can connect to a local MongoDB instance like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "from pymongo import MongoClient\n",
    "\n",
    "client = MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">**Note:** The **MongoClient object** in PyMongo is used to establish a connection to a MongoDB database. It represents a client-side connection to a MongoDB database and provides a way to interact with the database. With a MongoClient object, you can create and manipulate databases, collections, and documents. In this example, the MongoClient object is connecting to a MongoDB instance running on the same machine as the Python code (localhost) and using the default MongoDB port (27017). Once you have a MongoClient object, you can use it to access and manipulate the databases, collections, and documents in the MongoDB instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Work with databases and collections:** Once you have connected to MongoDB, you can work with databases and collections. To create a database, you can use the `client.db_name` syntax, where `db_name` is the name of the database. To create a collection, you can use the `db.collection_name` syntax, where `collection_name` is the name of the collection. For example, to create a database named `booksdb` and a collection named `books`, you can do the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "db = client.booksdb\n",
    "books = db.books\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Insert data into the collection:** To insert data into the collection, you can use the `insert_one` or `insert_many` method. For example, to insert a single book into the collection, you can do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "book = {\"title\": \"The Great Gatsby\", \"author\": \"F. Scott Fitzgerald\"}\n",
    "books.insert_one(book)\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Data modeling** in MongoDB is the process of designing and organizing data in a way that is optimized for the MongoDB document-oriented data model. It involves creating a schema that defines the structure, relationships, and constraints of the data, and using that schema to create collections and documents. The goal of data modeling in MongoDB is to ensure that the data is stored in a way that is efficient, flexible, and consistent with the requirements of the application.\n",

    "- **MongoDB Server:** This is the main component of MongoDB architecture, responsible for handling client requests, managing data storage, and executing queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Replication:** Replication is a key aspect of MongoDB architecture, providing high availability and data durability. MongoDB uses a replication mechanism known as replica sets, where data is replicated across multiple servers for redundancy.\n",

    "- **Sharding:** Sharding is the process of dividing data across multiple servers to distribute load and improve performance. MongoDB uses a sharding mechanism known as sharded clusters, where data is divided into smaller chunks called shards and distributed across multiple servers.\n",

    "- **Database:** A MongoDB database is a collection of related data stored together in a single unit. Databases are made up of collections, which are equivalent to tables in a relational database.\n",
